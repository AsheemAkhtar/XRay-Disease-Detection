# TB Detection from Chest X-Ray Images

Overview

This project is a deep learning-based approach for detecting tuberculosis (TB) from chest X-ray images using TensorFlow and Hugging Face Transformers. It leverages transfer learning with the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to classify chest X-rays as either "Normal" or "Tuberculosis".

Features

Binary classification: Normal vs Tuberculosis

Pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) for feature extraction

Custom training pipeline with TensorFlow

Visualization of training metrics

Flexible prediction pipeline for single and batch image inputs

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle: Tuberculosis (TB) Chest X-Ray Dataset. It contains X-ray images organized into two categories:

Normal: X-ray images of healthy individuals

Tuberculosis: X-ray images of individuals diagnosed with TB
